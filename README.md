My name is Wrenn.

I am a contender. I've always been intrinsically motivated to give my best in all that I do. This has taught me to be wise and passionate 
with my commitments. 

I am ambitious. I seek growth. 

These are the reasons why I am learning coding and statistics- to find a career that suits these core pieces of who I am.
